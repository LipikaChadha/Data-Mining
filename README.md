# Data-Mining

Performed pre-processing and Data Mining Techniques on Water Quality Dataset from Kaggle
Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

i)Pre-Processing
• Removing duplicates: Checking for and removing any duplicate entries in 
the dataset.
• Handling missing values: Checking for any missing values in the dataset and 
imputing them using appropriate techniques such as mean, median or 
mode imputation.
• Scaling: Scaling the dataset using a suitable scaling technique like Min-Max 
scaling or Standard scaling.

ii) Classification algorithms:
• Logistic Regression: It is a linear model used to predict binary outcomes. It 
is widely used in many applications due to its simplicity and interpretability.
• Random Forest Classifier: It is an ensemble model that uses multiple 
decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its high accuracy and 
robustness against overfitting.

iii) Clustering algorithms:
• K-means clustering: It is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the 
data into K clusters based on the similarity between data points. 
• Hierarchical clustering: It is a clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of 
clusters by iteratively merging smaller clusters into larger ones. It can 
provide insights into the structure of the data and can be used to visualize 
the data.
